            </h1>
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Nowadays, with the constant growth of technologies in the area of games, many of the cultures and old experiences
                are lost, such as retro games and also due to the difficulties of trying to preserve them, since in their development
                there are processes linked to legal documentation, controllers, platforms open and closed and in the way of
                extracting old media using specific tools, however this growth also makes it possible to develop games from the past
                using this new technology in an intuitive and low-cost way like old digital games. Despite the decline of arcades,
                classic games still add a lot of fun to users, however new video games with their modern platforms do not support
                these old versions, as they are not developed for this practice and have different hardware from classic games.
            </p>
            <p>    
            <strong>Arcade PI</strong> after some research, the Snes9x emulator was chosen, as it was the one that presented the best 
                performance in the developed project and served to run game software and to manage games. Snes9x has a large 
                library of games and is also free software, its main development and in order to allow the reproduction of game 
                images designed for Super Nintendo Entertainment System <strong> (SNES).</strong>
            </p>
            <h2>Snes9x Emulator History</h2>
            <p> Speaking a little about its creation and its history, the SNES9X was developed and created by Gary Henderson and 
                JerremyKoot, this was due to its two previous emulator models the Snes96 and Snes97. Due to this collaboration 
                between the two, a unique and more powerful emulator was developed, the <strong>SNES9X emulator.</strong></p>

         <h3>Figure 01:- You can see the game version of Super Mario World from 1990 and 1991. </h3>

        <p> Source: Super Mario World, Duhnascimento (2022). </p>
        <p>Some of its file extensions are: Snes9x Slot 2 Save State (001), Super Nintendo ROM Save File (SRM), Super 
            Nintendo Wild Card ROM File (SWC) and ZSNES Save File (ZST).For those who love old games and like the feeling of picking up the controller and playing a game like Super Mario World as if they were on a real console and 
            remembering those childhood moments are indescribable for people who like to play these games to describe this 
            sensation.  
        </p>
        <h2>Materials And Methods </h2>
        <P>Orange Pi is an open source single board computer, a new generation of arm64 development boards, which can run 
            operating systems such as Android TV 9.0, Ubuntu and Debian. The Orange Pi 3 LTS uses the Allwinner H6 chip 
            and has 2GB LPDDR3 RAM memory. 
        </P>
        <h2>Final Considerations</h2>
        <P>After much research and development of the project, it was observed that old games with all the good memories 
            kept in people's memories of that time, it becomes essential not to be part of their culture, as it was part of their lives 
            . With that in mind, the Orange PI - old digital games becomes a great console to remember this time that brought so 
            much joy to many, serving as a way of not forgetting these games, because people can have the same sensations as 
            before and also show the youngest who never felt the pleasure of playing on an old console.
